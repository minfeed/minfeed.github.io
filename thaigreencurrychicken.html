		<ol>
			<li>Cut the chicken into bite-sized slices and fry in a deep-walled frying pan or wok in coconut oil.</li>
			<li>Put water for the rice on to boil.</li>
			<li>Rice method 1: boil and strain like you would with pasta. Use a fine strainer. This method washes away a lot of the starch and there is no worry about water-to-rice ratio. Use enough water so that it does not boil dry.</li>
			<li>Rice method 2: two parts water to one part rice, bring to boil, cover and simmer for about 12-15 minutes (for white jasmine or basmati). Rinse the rice first to remove some starch.</li>
			<li>Slice bell pepper in strips and add to chicken.</li>
			<li>Trim the ends of the peas and/or beans and add to chicken.</li>
			<li>Drain the bamboo shoots and add.</li>
			<li>Cut the lemongrass stalk into a few pieces and add.</li>
			<li>Clear a spot in the middle of the pan and add a few big lumps of curry paste. Fry it up for a minute before mixing with everything else.</li>
			<li>Shake the coconut milk can really vigourously before opening to mix in the solidified bits. Pour in the pan, scraping out any remaining bits, and mix in.</li>
			<li>Add a few splashes of fish sauce, about a tablespoon.</li>
			<li>Simmer until the rice is ready.</li>
			<li>Plate up a bed of rice and scoop curry over top. The lemongrass pieces are not to eat, but are tasty to bite into.</li>
