			<li>Put on a kettle of water on to boil.</li>
			<li>Put on a pot of water to boil the potatoes.</li>
			<li>Peel and dice about 4 or 5 potatoes and par-boil for about 8 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add some olive oil to a non-stick wok or deep-walled frying pan.</li>
			<li>Dice the baloney and add to the pan. Separate the baloney slices before dicing so the pieces don't stick together. Fry on medium heat, stirring often.</li>
			<li>Put a cup of rice in a sieve and soak and rinse in cold water for about a minute.</li>
			<li>In a pot, add a high smoke-point oil like canola or sunflower. Over medium-high heat, break about a twoonie-size handful of vermicelli into small pieces and fry. Turn often with a fork until most of the vermicelli turns brown.</li>
			<li>Add about 4 cups of the previously boiled water to the vermicelli. It will sizzle, steam and boil right away.</li>
			<li>Add the rice, a heaped tablespoon or so of cinammon, and salt to the vermicelli pot.</li>
			<li>Stir, reduce heat to medium low, cover and let simmer for about 10 minutes. Add more hot water if it starts to dry out before the rice is cooked.</li>
			<li>Strain the potatoes and add to the frying pan. Add more oil as needed to crisp up the potatoes and baloney.</li>
			<li>Add garlic powder, onion powder/salt, salt and pepper.</li>
			<li>Try to catch the rice just when all the water is almost absorbed. Remove from the heat, remove the lid, and let stand a few minutes.</li>
			<li>When the baloney and potatoes are crisped up enough, add the rice and vermicelli and mix all together.</li>
