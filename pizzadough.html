			<li>Proof the yeast. Use warm, not hot, water. Try a thermometer once to get an idea of what 40°C feels like. To 1/4 cup water, stir in 8g (1 packet) yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar. Let rest for 10 minutes until it about doubles.</li>
			<li>In a large bowl, add 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup warm water, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the yeast mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon.</li>
			<li>Gradually add another 1 cup flour until it's mostly all mixed together.</li>
			<li>Get your hands in there and combine all the crumbly pieces into a ball.</li>
			<li>Dust the countertop with flour and knead the dough for a few minutes, stretching and pulling it out, folding back on top, squishing down, then squish and pull in a different direction.</li>
			<li>Form the dough into a ball, tucking the edges underneath into the middle. </li>
			<li>Clean out the mixing bowl and add a dollop of olive oil. Roll the dough ball in the oil until covered, then sit it with smooth side up, folded-under side down.</li>
			<li>Cover with a tea towel and let it rise for about an hour.</li>
			<li>Punch down and divide into two or four pieces depending on the size pizza you want. You can freeze some of the dough balls at this point.</li>
			<li>Option 1 - Pull and roll thin-crust: dust the counter, and pull and rolling pin the dough out into a pizza shape. Use right away, or cover with a moist warm tea towel and let it rest from 10 to 30 minutes depending on how much more you want to let it rise. </li>
			<li>Option 2 - Double rise puffy-crust: form the individual 2 or 4 pieces back into balls by folding under, being careful not to tear the tops. Squeeze the bottom like you're holding the stalk of a mushroom and pinch off any excess. Cover the dough balls and let rest again for an hour or two. After that do not punch down. Form into pizza shape by pushing down with fingertips in the middle and working outwards. When about half the desired radius, press and pinch down the edges to capture the air in the crust.</li>
			<li>Preheat over to 450°F</li>
			<li>Sprinkle cornmeal on the pizza pan to prevent sticking, and lay the dough across the pan.</li>
			<li>Add sauce, cheese, and toppings.</li>
			<li>Bake for 10-12 minutes on the second-from-top rack.</li>
