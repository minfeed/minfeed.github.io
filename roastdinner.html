		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Setup one rack in the middle and one a bit higher.
			<li>Place meat in a dutch oven or roasting pan, salt and pepper, and place in the oven. A pan with a lid will make for a more tender roast.</li>
			<li>Depending on the size of the roast, you might need to give the meat a head start. The veggies should go in about 50 mins before the meat will be done. Also if it's a good cut of meat you might want it to rest for a while after cooking, so time it to take it out before the final stint when the yorkies go in, as you cannot open the oven during that time.</li>
			<li>In a deep walled roasting pan, or a bowl if you're using a baking sheet, cube and add turnip, carrots, sweet potato, potatos, parsnips, and squash.</li>
			<li>Cut an onion into big chunks. Don't seperate the layers of the onion. Some of them will come apart as the veggies are stirred during cooking.</li>
			<li>Peel and chop the root end off several garlic cloves and add whole.</li>
			<li>Douse with olive oil and stir.</li>
			<li>Add rosemary, sage, parsely, thyme.</li>
			<li>Stir and spread evenly in the pan, and place in the oven, stirring every 20 mins or so.</li>
			<li>Yorkshire Puddings: they go in the oven with twenty minutes left, and do not open the oven again until they are done. So you need to get the timing of the meat and veggies right, and give the veggies one last stir before putting the yorkies in. If the veggies are getting dried out, pile them in a mound in the middle of their pan for this last stint.</li>
			<li>In a bowl add 1 cup flour, 1 cup milk, a pinch of salt, and 1 egg. Mix thoroughly.</li>
			<li>Pour olive oil in each well of a 12 cupcake tray. Smoosh the oil around the sides of the wells. Place the empty tray in the oven for 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Pour the batter into the cupcake tray, distributing evenly, and place in the oven on a top rack.</li>
			<li>Put the gravy mix on to boil, whisking frequently.</li>
			<li>Steam some fresh greens.</li>
			<li>Serve with horseradish for beef and mustard for pork.</li>
