			<li>Preheat oven to 400Â°F.</li>
			<li>Brown both sides of the chicken in a pan then place in a casserole dish.</li>
			<li>Using the same pan, heat tomato sauce, adding garlic, oregano or italian seasoning, chili flakes, and pepper.</li>
			<li>Cover the chicken in the casserole dish with the sauce. Crumble croutons over top, then cover with grated cheese.</li>
			<li>Cover with aluminum foil to prevent the cheese from browning too soon and place in the oven.</li>
			<li>Put a kettle of water on to boil.</li>
			<li>Saute diced onion.</li>
			<li>Soak 1.5 cups of rice in water to rinse off the starch, then strain.</li>
			<li>Smear olive oil over the bottom and sides of a deep-walled baking pan.</li>
			<li>To the onion add turmeric, paprika, and garlic.</li>
			<li>Add the rice to the pan and mix thoroughly with the onion-spice mix so the rice is fully coated.</li>
			<li>Spread the rice mixture evenly in the baking pan, and gently cover with 3.5 cups of the hot water. Try not to wash the spice coating around too much.</li>
			<li>Cover with aluminum foil or a cover, trying to seal the moisture in a best as possible, and place in the oven for about 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>After chicken has been in for about 20 minutes, remove it's aluminum foil so the cheese will brown, and bake for another 20 minutes.</li>
			<li>Let the chicken dish rest for at least 5 minutes before serving. Fluff the rice with a fork, scraping the crunchy bits off the side of the pan.</li>
